## Yautja Clans have been sighted on the Rim!
> _When I was little, we found a man. He looked like... like, butchered. The old woman in the village crossed themselves... and whispered crazy things- strange things. "El Diablo cazador de hombres." Only in the hottest years this happens- and this year, it grows hot. We begin finding our men. We found them sometimes without their skins... and sometimes much, much worse. ..."El cazador trofeo de los hombres" means "the demon who makes trophies of men"._ - __Anna Gonsalves__

 __[Yautja](https://rimworldavp.gamepedia.com/Yautjas)__ are one of the fiercest hunters in the known galaxy. Smart, cunning, strong and durable, their thirst for Glory of the hunt can never be sated.

####  Known Incompatabilities & Issues
level-this: if you dont kill a facehugger in one hit, it will level up its HP, so they can max out pretty quickly

Cybernet: possibe Fatal incompatability - unconfirmed

Headless Yautja: try removing any Children & Pregnancy mods and testing.
Pink Box around Yautja: this is usually due to them spawning with apparel that they arent allowed to wear, due to there being no textures for the Yautja body types.

Xenomorph AI is still a bit gimpy, we're working on it
