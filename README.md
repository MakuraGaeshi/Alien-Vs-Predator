⇐=============== Known Incompatabilities & Issues ================>
level-this: if you dont kill a facehugger in one hit, it will level up its HP, so they can max out pretty quickly

Cybernet: possibe Fatal incompatability - unconfirmed

Headless Yautja: try removing any Children & Pregnancy mods and testing.
Pink Box around Yautja: this is usually due to them spawning with apparel that they arent allowed to wear, due to there being no textures for the Yautja body types.

Xenomorph AI is still a bit gimpy, we're working on it
