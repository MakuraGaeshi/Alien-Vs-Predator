    <label>Armor - Acid</label>
    <description>The chance to affect Acid-related damage like burns.\n\nUpon taking damage, first this armor rating is reduced by the attack's armor penetration value. The remaining armor rating is then compared against a random number from 0 to 100.\n\n    -If the random number is under half the armor rating, the damage deflects harmlessly.\n    -If the random number is over half the armor rating, but not higher than the armor rating, the damage is mitigated. This means it is reduced by half.\n    -If the random number is greater than the armor rating, the armor has no effect.\n\nFor example, at 90% armor rating against an attack with 10% armor penetration, there is a 40% chance of deflecting the attack harmlessly, and a 40% chance of mitigating the damage.\n\nIn the case of apparel armor, each layer of apparel applies its armor to the attack separately, from the outside in.</description>
