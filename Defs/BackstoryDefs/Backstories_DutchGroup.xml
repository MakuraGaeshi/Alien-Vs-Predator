    <baseDescription>In his school days, [PAWN_nameDef] had been a football star. After leaving college, he attended boot camp with Jim Hopper in 1967 and had a brother in the NYPD./n/n Dutch went on to serve in the Vietnam War alongside his close friend Al Dillon, seeing action at Da Nang.[6] At one point during the war, Dutch was captured and brutally tortured by the Viet Cong; the prolonged interrogation eventually caused him to become resistant to pain. Following the Vietnam War, he served in various commando units, including a mission in Malaysia in 1979 with Hopper that nearly claimed both of their lives. He later reunited with Dillon for operations in Thailand, and while serving there the men obtained matching lighters of personal significance.</baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>In 1980, [PAWN_nameDef] left the United States Army and set up his own private military company, mainly recruiting other US Army personnel./n/nPAWN_nameDef]'s team saw operations in Angola, Cambodia, Lebanon and Afghanistan. More recently, the team dealt with a terrorist siege at the Sudanese Embassy in Berlin, Germany, assaulting the building and eliminating seven terrorists in under ten seconds. Not only did the operation in the center of the city go totally unnoticed by the world's press, the terrorists were eliminated before they even had a chance to call in their demands./n/nA notable condition of employment for [PAWN_nameDef] and his men was that they only ever operate as a rescue team, and he refused to take on any mission where the prime objective was the elimination of enemy personnel, such as a proposed operation in Libya that he turned down.</baseDescription>
